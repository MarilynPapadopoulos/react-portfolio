# React App Portfolio

This is a single page application using React.  

## Description 

This app is a portfolio of my work.  The portfolio is intended to gain employment in the future. The navigation items remain highlighted while the user is on that page.  The contact page displays an error when the user fails to provide the necessary information. There is a link to my resume via google that the user can download. 
I had the opportunity to use React Bootstrap for the first time.  The biggest challenge was over riding the Bootstrap styling.  The class name 'container' is used repeatedly throughout by Bootstrap and it took some investigating to see where I needed to over ride it. Being a single page applications the pages 'load' quickly however the photos are slow to load.  There is a lot of potential for improvement in styling the app but the functionality has a great base.
