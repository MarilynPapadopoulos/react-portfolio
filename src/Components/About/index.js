      <p className="about">My name is Marilyn and this portoflio showcases what I have learned as a web developer student.  I will receive my certificate from the University of Toronto Bootcamp program in August of this year.  Until recently, I was working as a flight attendant.  This was a very rewarding career and the perks were amazing!   
    
    I received my bachelors degree from the University of Windsor.  While there, I attended some HTML and CSS classes.  My education also focoused on logic and argument. I thoroughly enjoyed those types of concepts and decided to work that into a new career.  Always intrigued by the world of a web developer I decided to take the plunge!</p>
